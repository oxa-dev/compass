title: Roadmap & Planning
---

This document outlines the strategic direction, milestones, and organizational structure for the OXA (Open Exchange Architecture) project.

## Project Vision

OXA aims to become the standard specification for representing scientific documents and their components as structured JSON objects, enabling seamless exchange, interoperability, and long-term preservation of scientific knowledge.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Schema Maturity**: Develop and stabilize core OXA schemas for common scientific document components
2. **Ecosystem Adoption**: Foster adoption across major authoring tools (Stencila, MyST, Quarto) and publishing systems
3. **Interoperability**: Enable conversion between OXA and other formats (JATS, Markdown variants, etc.)
4. **Community Growth**: Build a vibrant community of contributors, implementers, and users
5. **Standards Alignment**: Align with and contribute to relevant open science standards and initiatives

## Current Focus Areas

### Phase 1: Core Schema Development (Current)

- **Setup Technical Infrastructure**: Build out the technical infrastructure
- **Setup RFC and Community Processes**: Build out the community infrastructure
- **Document Structure**: Core document, section, and paragraph schemas
- **Basic Content**: Text, emphasis, strong, links, and other inline elements
- **Metadata**: Authors, affiliations, funding, licenses
- **Math and Code**: Mathematical expressions and code blocks
- **Citations and References**: Mathematical expressions and code blocks
- **Figures and Media**: Panels, images, tables, and other media elements

Goals:

- Complete core schema development
- Release v0.1.0 of core schemas
- Release language-specific type packages
- Release initial CLI with documentation
- Publish initial specification documentation
- Begin RFC process
- Establish community meeting schedule

### Phase 2: Extended Content Types (Planned)

- **Executable Components**: Notebooks, interactive figures, reproducible code
- **Cross-references**: Citations, references, and document linking
- **Modular Documents**: Parts, components, and reusable elements
- **Versioning**: Document versioning and provenance tracking
- **Bundling/Container**: Container level information for complete research packages

Goals:

- Extended content type development
- Expand community engagement
- Develop conversion tools for major formats
- Begin tool integration discussions

### Phase 3: Tool Integration (Planned)

- **Converters**: Bidirectional conversion tools for major formats
- **Validators**: Schema validation tools and libraries
- **Publishers**: Publishing pipeline integration

Goals:

- Tool integration partnerships
- Repository integration partnerships
- Standards alignment activities
- Community growth initiatives

## Review and Updates

This planning document is a living document and should be reviewed and updated:

- Quarterly by the Steering Council
- After major milestones or changes in direction
- Based on community feedback and evolving needs
