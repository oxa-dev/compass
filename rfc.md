title: Request For Comment Process
---

The OXA Request For Comment (RFC) process is the primary way for the OXA community to propose, discuss, and decide on significant changes to technical standards, workflows, or governance. It provides a structured path to reaching consensus on new ideas, documenting decisions, and engaging the wider community in project direction.

### Goals of the RFC Process

- **Transparency:** Ensure that all major decisions are made openly and with input from the community.
- **Inclusivity:** Encourage participation from all stakeholders—researchers, developers, publishers, and users—regardless of background or expertise.
- **Structured Decision-Making:** Provide a standardized, documented workflow for proposing, discussing, and approving changes, so decisions don’t get lost or made ad hoc.
- **Record Keeping:** Maintain a clear, open record of the rationale for decisions, proposals made, and the history of project evolution.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Facilitate ongoing dialogue to improve OXA standards and practices as needs and technologies evolve.

## Proposals

Proposals are discussed in the [RFC](https://github.com/oxa-dev/rfc) repository and in the [Discord](https://discord.oxa.dev) `#rfc` channel. See the [RFC](https://github.com/oxa-dev/rfc) repository for more detailed discussions. All RFCs go through a [decision making process](./rfc-process.md) to be accepted and implemented.
