title: OXA Team Compass
---

The OXA Team Compass is the central resource for governance, planning, and community engagement for the Open Exchange Architecture (OXA) project.

The OXA project is stewarded by the [Continuous Science Foundation](https://continuousfoundation.org), a grassroots, community-driven organization that brings together researchers, tool builders, publishers, and standards groups to support modular, continuous ways of publishing research.

## Purpose

This compass serves as a guide for:

- **Steering Council** membership and governance for the OXA project
- **Decision-making processes** and policies
- **Planning documents** and roadmaps
- **Meeting agendas** and minutes
- **Community resources** and contribution guidelines

## Steering Council

The OXA Steering Council is responsible for strategic direction, governance decisions, and ensuring the long-term health of the OXA project.

## Governance

### Decision-Making

Changes and improvements to OXA are completed through a community [Request For Comment](./rfc.md) process. The Steering Council tries to make all decisions through consensus. When consensus cannot be reached, decisions are made by majority vote of the Steering Council.

### Membership

Steering Council members are selected based on their commitment to the OXA project, technical expertise, and ability to represent diverse perspectives in the scientific publishing ecosystem. New members are added through a nomination and voting process by existing Steering Council members.

### Term Length

Steering Council members serve for renewable terms, typically two years, with staggered terms to ensure continuity.
